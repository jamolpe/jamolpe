# Jamolpe

Hi All! Im Javier Software a engineer currently working for Vueling Airlines and AXA as a cloud engineer/Full stack developer.

Since I started my journey as a engineer, I have been interested in learning new technologies, I love sharing knowledge with my colleagues and learning about different businesses and needs that software can help to solve.

I have experience working as a full-stack but my main role during this last year has been in the backend and I'm currently working with microservices architectures data analysis and cloud.

- Nodejs
- Golang
- React
- Typescript
- React
- Python
- MongoDB
